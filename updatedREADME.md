Introduction
This notebook explores and analyzes sales data from Big Mart stores. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and the development of a predictive model to estimate sales. The goal is to gain insights into factors affecting sales and to make accurate sales predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available in the big_mart_sales.csv file. It contains various attributes such as Item ID, Item Weight, Item Type, Outlet ID, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type, and more. Additionally, it includes the Item Outlet Sales as the target variable.

Analysis Steps
The analysis is divided into the following steps:

Data Exploration: Understand the dataset's structure, check for missing values, and explore data distributions.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
Modeling: Develop a predictive model (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to estimate sales.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
